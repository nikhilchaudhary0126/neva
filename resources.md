# Neighborhood Evacuation

### Inspiration

Recent events in Ukraine motivated us to create a web app that would allow civilians to fulfill their immediate needs for shelter, evacuation and supplies. Whether it be the prospect of unexpected war or unavoidable natural disasters, we need these evacuation protocols to ensure the safety of people living in affected areas. Evacuation is made easy with the use of this app, which has the potential to save numerous lives.

### What it does?
Helps you find shelter, supplies and evacuation routes in times of need
Also it allows users to post locations for the new shelters or evacuation routes or where to find the essential supplies in the time of emergency or war like situations

## Challenges we ran into
We were initially trying to integrate google maps through KML file but we were not able to integrate it with maps so we had to change our approach and build it using Java script google api.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were successfully able to integrate google maps with the web apps and also even though we were not use to development in the the django we were able to complete the web app and able to deliver functioning output.

## What we learned
Learned a lot about what we do not know. Bootstrap for example is a tool that simplifies designing the UI, yet it does have its limitations and caveats and has to be used in a very specific way which is defined by the rules set by bootstrap. I learned that drop downs take up the complete width of the parent and need to be limited in size manually and does not happen out of the box. And is a pain to do that.

## What's next for Neighborhood Evacuation
Win a title in the hackathon. Share the repo with the world for whoever would want to extend the scope of this project.
We can expand it for more calamity and different type of categories can be added so that more people can take benefit of that also we can add more checks so that any one can not add the random information and avoid misinformation
