# Neighborhood Evacuations

### Inspiration

Recent events in Ukraine motivated us to create a web app that would allow civilians to fulfill their immediate needs for shelter, evacuation and supplies. Whether it be the prospect of unexpected war or unavoidable natural disasters, we need these evacuation protocols to ensure the safety of people living in affected areas. Evacuation is made easy with the use of this app, which has the potential to save numerous lives.


### Runtime Instructions
* This webapp uses external apis and keys which should be defined in local runtime environments.

* Install all python packages using:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
